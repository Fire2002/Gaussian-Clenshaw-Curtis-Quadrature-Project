# Gaussian-Clenshaw-Curtis-Quadrature-Project
This project investigates the methods of Gaussian quadrature and Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature that make solving nonlinear polynomial systems of equations (for the condition $E_n (x^k) = 0$) possible.

The project solves problems that include:
- computation of Legendre polynomials roots to represent the abscissas in the corresponding Gaussian quadrature.
- computation of Gaussian weights via Gaussian abscissas.
- construction of a 1-D and 2-D integrator via Gaussian quadrature.
- investigation of the Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature.
